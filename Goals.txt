Multiplayer bugs:
1. When using the camera as the position and direction for the ball, the firing off becomes inconsistent due to it being a shared component
2. How can we make the ball viewmodel work right?


IEnumerable<CameraComponent> cam = Scene.GetAll<CameraComponent>();
		var pcam = cam.FirstOrDefault();

		PlayerCamera = pcam.GameObject;

		player = PlayerInfo.Local.player;
		PlayerMdl = PlayerInfo.Local.PlayerMdl;
		ItBallMdl = PlayerInfo.Local.ItBallMdl;
		PlayerCamera = PlayerInfo.Local.PlayerCamera;
